The current president is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.[210] The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government.[17] Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The National Congress is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. In 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a "flawed democracy", ranking 46th in the report,[211] and Freedom House classified it as a free country at Freedom in the World report.</p>

                    Law
                </h2>
                <p>The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, promulgated on 5 October 1988, and the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.[218] As of July 2022, there have been 124 amendments.[219] The highest court is the Supreme Federal Court. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.[220] Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" (leis orgânicas), which act in a similar way to constitutions.[221] Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.[17] Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.[17] There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.[17]</p>
